# Challenge analyzing MechaCar's production data

# Develop multiple linear regression that looked at the following metrics of the MechaCar production data
- vehicle length
- spoiler angle
- vehicle weight
- ground clearance

After applying the regression, the coeficients for vehicle length and ground clearance displayed the greatest impact

Residual standard error: 8.853 on 45 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7032,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6768 
F-statistic: 26.65 on 4 and 45 DF,  p-value: 2.277e-11

R-Squared is high at 70% and p-value is 2.2 which means that both vehicle length and ground clearance both are good predictors for this model
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, which indicates high correlation (again R squared being 70+)


From the SuspensionCoil Data we can see the following stats summarized:

5 variance                   76.2 
6 standard deviation          8.73

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch.
Which is true since the variance is 76.2 which means it meets the standard requirement for pounds per inch.
The t-test shows that the suspension coil is statistically similar to the sample population of 1500 pounds per inch.
p value is .34 which is mich higher than the 0.05 which means we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

# Design a study that compares the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market

We can do trial and error with a few models.  For example we can use the ANOVA Test since we want to assess if there is a statistical difference 
between the distirbution meas between two samples (MecharCar vs comparable vehicles in the general market).

We can break out the variables of interest such as cost, fuel efficeincy, color, model year, size etc so that we can compare the distribution by avg, median, max 
and min across the MechaCar vs comparable cars.
